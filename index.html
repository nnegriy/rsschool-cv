      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>I started my career in an information agency as a web developer, but was soon forced to change my field of activity. During this time web-technology has gone far ahead. I hope my studies at RS-School will help me to bridge this gap becoming a proficient Fullstack Developer (there is an experience developing have been programming the backend on Oracle software solutions).</p>

      <h2>Briefly About Myself</h2>
      <p>I have been working in the IT field for more than 20 years. In my work, I try to close the uncovered areas of work in the department as much as possible, so during this time I worked in different positions. Sometimes the field of activity had to be changed radically. I like to acquire new skills and knowledge, as well as apply them in practice.</p>
